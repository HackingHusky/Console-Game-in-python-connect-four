# Connect Four Console Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Connect Four game in Python. Play against a friend in the console and enjoy!

## How to Play

1. Run the script in your terminal or command prompt.
2. Players take turns to choose a column to drop their piece into.
3. The first player to get four of their pieces in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.
5. After the game ends, you will be asked if you want to play again. Type `yes` to start a new game or `no` to exit.

## Running the Game

To run the game, simply execute the Python script:

```sh
python connect_four.py
